# Hash-Map-Finder

This program was made to help a friend who accidentaly saved his collections in the wrong format and needed a way to find every map as the maps were in hash format.

All you need is the .txt with the hash numbers of each beatmap, you don't need to change anything just copy the directory and paste it on the line you need to replace, remember to delete both // as it's meant for you to know the place to paste what you need to put.

Example of the hash files:
